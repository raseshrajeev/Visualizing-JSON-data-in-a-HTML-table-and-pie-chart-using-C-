A simple project that demonstrates how to parse JSON data using C# and visualize it in a responsive HTML table and an interactive pie chart. Perfect for dashboards, reports, and analytics applications.

Features
1.JSON Parsing: Read and process JSON data in C#.
2.Dynamic HTML Table: Display data with sorting and conditional row highlighting (e.g., highlight if value is below threshold).
3.Pie Chart Visualization: Show percentage distribution using Chart.js or Google Charts.
4.Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile.

Tech Stack
1.Backend: C# (.NET)
